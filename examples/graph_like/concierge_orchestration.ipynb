      "Final Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "The task involved a series of interactions aimed at authenticating a user and subsequently managing their account balance. Here is a comprehensive summary of the process and outcomes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **User Authentication**: \n",
      "   - The user was prompted to provide their username, which was successfully recorded.\n",
      "   - Following this, the user was asked for their password. Upon providing the password, the user was successfully logged in, and a session token was stored in the user state. This confirmed that the authentication process was complete.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Account Balance Inquiry**:\n",
      "   - After successful authentication, the user requested their account balance. The system responded that the account balance for the user \"john123\" is $1000.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Funds Transfer**:\n",
      "   - The user then initiated a transfer of $100. The system confirmed that the transfer was successfully completed to the account number 81092837881.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Conclusion**:\n",
      "   - The entire process, from authentication to balance inquiry and funds transfer, was executed smoothly. The user is now logged in with a valid session token, their account balance has been confirmed, and the requested transfer has been successfully processed.\n",
      "\n",
